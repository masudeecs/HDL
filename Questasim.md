## The simulation process involves different steps such as:
1. Creating the physical library & mapping it with logical library.
2. Compilation.
3. Optimization.
4. Simulation.

## Following are the Questa commands used for Batch mode simulation:
1. `vlib` – To create a physical working library.
2. `vmap` – To map logical library with physical library.
3. `vlog` – To compile Verilog & SystemVerilog files.
4. `vopt` – To optimize the design.
5. `vsim` – To load the design into the simulator.
6. `run` – To run the simulation.
7. `qverilog` – library creation, mapping, compile, and running simulation together.
